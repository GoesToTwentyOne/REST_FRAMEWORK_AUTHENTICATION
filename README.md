# Unlocking Security and Authentication with Django REST Framework

Welcome to our repository dedicated to showcasing the power of Django REST Framework's essential security and authentication features. Explore the keynotes and features to understand how you can leverage these capabilities for your own projects.

## Key Features

### Permissions
- Fine-tune access control by assigning specific permissions to users and groups.
- Control who can create, read, update, or delete resources in your Django application.
- Create custom permissions tailored to your application's unique requirements.

### Token Authentication
- Implement robust token-based authentication for secure API access.
- Protect your endpoints with unique tokens issued to each authenticated user.
- Enable stateless authentication, allowing seamless integration with client-side applications.

### Logout
- Provide users with the ability to log out securely, invalidating their authentication tokens.
- Enhance security by ensuring that users can terminate their sessions when needed.
- Maintain control over user sessions and access management.

### Login
- Streamline user login processes using Django REST Framework's built-in login view.
- Generate authentication tokens upon successful login for API access.
- Offer a smooth and standardized login experience to your users.
